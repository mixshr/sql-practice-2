#### The creation code
``` sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
   Code INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   Name NVARCHAR NOT NULL ,
   Budget REAL NOT NULL 
);
 
 CREATE TABLE Employees (
   SSN INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   Name TEXT NOT NULL ,
   LastName VARCHAR NOT NULL ,--since question 2 asks about removing duplicate - text must be converted if the answer is using distinct
   Department INTEGER NOT NULL , 
   CONSTRAINT fk_Departments_Code FOREIGN KEY(Department) 
   REFERENCES Departments(Code)
);
```
#### Sample datase
``` sql
INSERT INTO Departments(Code,Name,Budget) VALUES(14,'IT',65000);
INSERT INTO Departments(Code,Name,Budget) VALUES(37,'Accounting',15000);
INSERT INTO Departments(Code,Name,Budget) VALUES(59,'Human Resources',240000);
